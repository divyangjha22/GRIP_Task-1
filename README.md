# Task-1
**Predicting the Percentage of a Student based on the Number of Hours Studied:**

This project aims to create a simple linear regression model that can predict the percentage of a student based on the number of hours studied. The dataset used for this project contains the number of hours studied and the corresponding percentage of a group of students.

The project uses Python programming language and the following libraries:

- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy for numerical operations
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning modeling

The project consists of the following steps:

1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data cleaning and preparation
3. Data visualization
4. Model creation and evaluation
5. Prediction using the trained model

The model created in this project can be used by educators or students to predict their performance based on the number of hours they study. This can help them plan their study schedule and prepare for exams accordingly.

To run this project, clone the repository and install the required libraries. Then, run the Jupyter notebook to reproduce the results. The notebook contains detailed explanations of each step and code snippets for reference.

**Conclusion:**

This project demonstrates how simple linear regression can be used to predict the percentage of a student based on the number of hours studied. The model created in this project can be used by educators and students to plan their study schedule and prepare for exams accordingly. The project also showcases how Python and its libraries can be used for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning modeling.
